A replacement font for Topaz 8pt.  It's proportional so you'll need
Kickstart 2.0+ to use it on a Workbench screen.  Looks best on a
High Res non-laced screen.  Sans serif font totally designed from
scratch.

This is an improved version of my wbfont uploaded in 1997 that I never
got round to re-uploading.  Backup the original first in case you prefer
it!  Made with the aid of "Typeface", available elsewhere on Aminet.

Remember to update Cachefont in MCP if you use it!

FREEWARE:  though if you like it and decide to use it then let me know!
