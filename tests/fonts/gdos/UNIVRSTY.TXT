     "University Roman" is a Roman-style font that was adapted from a 
Publishing Partner (tm) font file created by Bernie LaGrave (UNIV_RMN.ARC).

     I have edited the horizontal serifs on most of the characters, as well
the cross-bars on "t" and "f" to be thicker.  I have edited the "Q", "R", "W",
and "w" characters to contain continuous outlines.  This makes the entire font 
compatible with Outline Art (tm).  The font is usable as small as the 12 pt 
size,  but looks much better at larger sizes > 24 pts.

     "University Bold" was created to be 25% wider and thicker than
"University Roman".  "University Roman" is narrow in appearance.  The bold
lines in "University Bold" are subtle.  However, I consider the wider 
characters of "University Bold" to be more pleasing than those in "University 
Roman".
